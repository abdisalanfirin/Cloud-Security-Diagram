Cload Security Diagram


I set up network diagram that shows my entire cloud setup, including Ansible jump box and the Docker containers running on each VM.
This document can be used as part of a portfolio to demonstrate my ability.

Instructions
I used the free account at draw.io to diagram the entire cloud network I have created.

My diagram shows the following:

Azure resource group
Virtual network with IP address range
Subnet range
Flow of specific traffic (e.g., HTTP, SSH)
Security group blocking traffic
Load balancer
All 4 VMs that I have launched
Where Docker and Ansible are deployed.
